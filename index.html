            The Tom Fox Painting Award winner for 2014/15 is Martina Gleeson.
            Martina’s interests lie in observing the mannerisms of human beings.
            She enjoys producing images of her observations in a humorous and
            exaggerated manner and aims to highlight overlooked scenarios within
            a satirical narrative. Gleeson works in paint, silkscreen
            printmaking and video. Martina Gleeson’s exhibition will open on
            Thursday October 15th at 6pm and will run until Monday 2nd November.
            All are welcome.

            The winner of the Tom Fox bursary award for 2013/14 was Trish Taylor
            Thompson. Limerick Printmakers Studio & Gallery are delighted to
            present ’45 for Valour’, a solo exhibition of new work by the visual
            artist Trish Taylor Thompson. The exhibition will be officially
            opened by Tracy Fahey, Head of Department of Fine Art & Postgraduate
            Studies in the Limerick School of Art & Design on Armistice Day,
            Tuesday 11th November at 6pm. This exhibition will be available to
            view in The Coach House at No. 2 Pery Square until Tuesday 9th
            December. ‘45 for Valour’ is a series of oil paintings on linen
            created in response to the one hundredth anniversary of the advent
            of the First World War. This transformative period in history
            prompted Trish to explore in further depth the ‘war to end all wars’
            from an Irish perspective. A focus developed on the forty-five Irish
            soldiers who were awarded the Victoria Cross for their heroic deeds
            during The Great War.

            As everyone knows, Limerick School of Art & Design was the place
            where Toms work found a place to thrive and grow. Therefore it is
            also fitting that an award is created in his name for a graduate of
            LSAD by the Fox family to encourage a graduate painter in the early
            stages of their career by having a prominent solo exhibition in a
            well established gallery.

            Welcome to Jumped Up Country Boy, a retrospective website
            documenting the artworks of Thomas Fox. An exhibition of Toms’ work
            entitled “B-Sides” is being held at the Church Gallery of Limerick
            School of Art & Design on January 11th 2012, and this website will
            act as a companion for that event, and also provide an eternal
            online home for Toms’ artwork. Please do return to visit the site
            often, as the “Thoughts” page will give an opportunity for people
            who knew Tom to leave comments and messages, all of which contribute
            greatly to this retrospective of the man and the artist.
