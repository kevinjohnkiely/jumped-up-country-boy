            I used to hang out with Tom on the bus from limerick to kilfinnane
            when i was going to LSAD between 2001-2005. I skulled a few pints
            with him and we have a few fags in Kellehers on the weekends and
            we’d rant on about the carry on in the world and talk art and rant
            on about that…never a dull moment in Tom’s company. I got a phone
            call saying he had passed away, i did’nt make it to his funeral. I
            remember him well…how i made onto this site was through the
            knowledge of “The Tom Fox busrary award”. Great to see there was a
            retropective of his work, and I’m sure he would be laughing the
            paint off Kellehers walls at the thought of busrary in his honour.

            Brilliant Kevin, hard to believe at one stage he was a devout
            Vegetarian and vene a Vegan at one stage, although from time to time
            even during that phase he still made it to abrakebabra. He even had
            a dog called “Morrissey” of course who he tried to force to be a
            vegetarian as well. The poor dog kept running away to his mother’s
            house to get a decent meal. Thanks again Kevin from all his family
            for this. Paintings coming down today but it was brilliant to see
            them all together like that.

            Great to see peoples comments, I said I’d post up one of what will
            be many memories of Tom that I have…it was that moment when I first
            really got to know him during the Art PLC course in Limerick Senior
            College in 96/97, and we were drinking quiet early in the evening
            (as we used to do!) and me and Tom decided to go down to Abrekebabra
            for a bite to eat. We must have been talking about the movie “The
            Field” in the chipper, because on coming out onto the street Tom
            decided he was the Bull McCabe and I was his son. He proceeded to
            shout loudly at me “GO ON TADGH! TAKE THE YANK!!!” and didnt stop
            til we got back to Mickey Martins. I was howling with laughter, but
            thats what I liked about Toms sense of humour, the spontaneity of
            it. More memories to come!

            I work in a bar in Kilfinane that Tom used to frequent, one night he
            came in from the smoking area and camly asked me for a “pint of
            heineken and a hairdryer” I’ll leave the details to your imagination
            but I always liked speaking with Tom.
